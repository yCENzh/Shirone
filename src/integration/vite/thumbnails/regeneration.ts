 * Generation used to live only in the `dev` and `build` script chains. A

 * tarball came from the template's demo content, so images the user added got
 * none. Running from the integration fixes both modes with one code path, the
 * same way `icon/regeneration.ts` does for the icon collection.
 *
 * Unlike the icon collection, these write into `public/`, which Astro copies
 * verbatim — nothing participates in module resolution. `buildStart` is
 * therefore early enough, and it also keeps `astro sync` from paying for sharp.
